# SUSI for School

This project provides a Tkinter-based application for exploring admission results from Excel files and creating interactive HTML reports.

## Requirements

Install the third-party dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `openpyxl`
- `xlrd`
- `plotly`

`Tkinter` is part of Python's standard library, so it doesn't need to be installed separately.
